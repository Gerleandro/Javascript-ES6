                    <p>The Asian tiger, recognized for its orange fur and black stripes, faces significant risks of extinction due to illegal hunting and habitat loss. Males can weigh over 300 kg, emphasizing their imposing presence. </p>
                    <p>Global conservation initiatives, such as reserves and captive breeding programs, aim to protect these felines. </p>

                    <p> Preserving these animals is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and the rich cultural heritage associated with them.</p>
